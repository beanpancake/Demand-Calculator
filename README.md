# Demand Calculator

This project now includes a React + TypeScript front-end for calculating
residential electrical service demand. The original `demand.py` Tkinter
implementation remains for reference.

## Development

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Type-check the project

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The application provides a simple form where users can enter loads in watts
or breaker amps. The calculation logic mirrors the original Python version.
